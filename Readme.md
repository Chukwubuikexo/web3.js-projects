# Web3.js Projects

This repository contains my first projects in Web3, documenting my learning journey into blockchain development and applications, with a focus on Ethereum (Ether.js).

## Overview

The scripts in this repository showcase various aspects of blockchain and Web3 development, including:

- Examining data within blocks.
- Working productively with smart contracts for decentralized applications (dApps).
- Setting up safe wallets.
- Linking smart contracts with websites to build decentralized web applications.
- Verifying smart contracts on Etherscan.

Through these projects, I explored the foundational concepts of blockchain development and applied them to create functional and secure decentralized solutions.
